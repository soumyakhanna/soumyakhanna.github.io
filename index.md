# About Me

My name is Soumya Khanna and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Virginia Tech. My interests in CS are Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Virtual Reality. Over the past summer, I learned mobile application development using ReactNative while participating in a hackathon. I'm currently working on two research projects in echolab under Dr. Sang Won Lee. I'm actively involved with VT clubs and organizations such as Developer Student Club, Student Engineers' Council, Association of Women in Computing, Engineers' Forum, and CEED International Team.
